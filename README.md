### We came to this project with ideas on making the company landing page more accessible to all Internet users, including those of different abilities.

#### To achieve these goals, I made changes to the HTML and CSS code, including:
##### HTML
 - Adding <nav> tags in the header to better outline the page architecture.
 - Changing some `<div>` tags to <section> to better define the content on the page.
 - Changing `<div id="footer">` to the semantic tag `<footer>`

##### CSS 
 - Condensing a good deal of repetitive code into one class to apply necessary styling.
 - Changing the class names in the index to make sure the styling remains consistent.
 - Making the code that is on the page easier to navigate for other developers by adding comments.
  
#### This project will be even more successful with more work on the CSS styling.
##### Changes that I would recommend include:
  - Using flexbox styling to wrap text and keep page layout consistent across screens.
  - Using mediaquery to allow for different layouts on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
  - Compressing images to allow for faster page loading.
